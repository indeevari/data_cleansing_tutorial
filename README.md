Data cleansing tutorial in Pandas for Chipy scientific SIG

## Goal
With all the media about vaccines causing autism since ~2009, we want to explore the rates of vaccinations over the years. For this tutorial, we will focus on Polio. Some potential end goals are:
- Has there been an overall decrease in the vaccination rates?
	- Looking at data from years ending in 2005, 2010, and 2015
- What schools decreased the most from 2005 to 2015?
- What vaccines decreased the most from 2005 to 2015?
- OPTIONAL: What schools are at the highest risk of decreasing further?


## Methodology Overview
- Metrics
	- Percentage protected = protected / enrollment


## Tasks
- Tool setup
	- Recommend Anaconda on Python 2.7
- Merging 04-05 to 
- Merging 12-13 and 13-14 given the following issues:
	- Pay attention to RCDTS specifically the hyphen
	- Columns are not in the same order
	- Columns are not named the same
	- 13-14 has sheets, 12-13 is all in columns
